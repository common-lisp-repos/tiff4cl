# tiff4cl

A TIFF file parser that reads the tags leaving the actual image data
alone.

# fork

This is a fork of tiff4cl, which was written by Walter C. Pelissero.

The original version is available via Quicklisp and the [author's
website](http://wcp.sdf-eu.org/software/index.html).

As far as I can tell, there is no original or up-to-date repository
available for it, so it's a fork but not in the GitHub sense.

This repository's initial commit contains a verbatim copy of the
version that's currently in Quicklisp, tiff4cl-20150804-http.
